    The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters.
    No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be
    officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum
    blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for
    free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet,
    but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. 
    Now they must be purchased from someone
    via the marketplace that's also embedded 
    in the blockchain. Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale. Below, you'll find information about the status of each Punk in the market. Punks with a blue background are not for sale and have no current bids. Punks with a red background are available for sale by their owner. Finally, punks with a purple background have an active bid on them.
    See the marketplace instructions below to 
    acquire your very own punk. You should also 
    join the Discord Chat, which includes a bot
     that announces all bids, offers and sales in realtime.

        <h1> What is a CryptoPunk? </h1> 
        <p> The CryptoPunks are 24x24 pixel art images, 
        generated algorithmically. Most are punky-looking guys and girls, 
        but <br> there are a few rarer types mixed in: Apes, 
        Zombies and even the odd Alien. Every punk has their 
        own profile page that shows their attributes as well as their 
        ownership/for-sale status (<a href="#">here's</a> an example).</p>
        <h1> What exactly is going on here? </h1>
        <p> Cryptocurrency was made famous by Bitcoin, 
            but Bitcoin is designed just to transact and 
            store ownership of Bitcoin itself. We are using a 
            successor to Bitcoin called Ethereum which allows 
            for arbitrary computer code to be executed on the 
            blockchain and the results of the execution to be 
            stored forever. This is pretty cool! Normally code 
            is run on a server somewhere and you basically need 
            to trust the person running the server. Ethereum 
            lets everyone execute the code, show each other 
            what result they got, and agree that the code was 
            executed properly and fairly.
            We have written code that lives on the blockchain 
            that anyone can use to buy and sell Punks with anyone 
            else in the world. An interesting aspect of this 
            system is that we no longer have any control over 
            the code running CryptoPunks! Once we released it 
            onto the blockchain it became permanently embedded 
            there and can no longer be modified by anyone. 
            This is scary for us as developers because we worry 
            about bugs, but it is also a very powerful feature 
            of the system. It allows a user verify that there 
            are indeed only 10,000 punks, check that we can't 
            steal them from you, and basically make sure that 
            everything we told you about the code is true.</p>

            <h1> How do I get a Punk? </h1>
            <p> 1. Download and install a Chrome browser plugin
                 called MetaMask. This will allow websites 
                 (that you authorize) access to your Ethereum account.</p>
            <p> 2. If you made a new account, buy some Ether. The 
                MetaMask plugin has a button that will allow you to buy 
                Ether from Coinbase.</p>
            <p> 3. Once you have the plugin installed, this website 
                will recognize it and add buttons that allow you 
                to bid on, buy and sell punks directly in the interface.</p>
            <p> 4. For example, you can buy Punk <a href="#">#8656</a> for 
                66.79 ETH ($105,596.33 USD).</p>
            <h1> Details and FAQ </h1>
            <p> <b> Where are the images for the punks stored? </b></p>
            <p> When originally released, the actual images of the punks 
                were too large to store on the blockchain, so we took a 
                hash of the composite image of all the punks and embeded 
                it into the contract. You can verify that the punks 
                being managed by the Ethereum contract are the True 
                Official Genuine CryptoPunks™ by calculating an SHA256 
                hash on the cryptopunks image and comparing it to the 
                hash stored in the contract.
                Since then, due to some clever compression ideas and  
                some help from friends of the punks we have managed to 
                put the entire image and attribute data fully on chain. 
                You can read more about the mechanisms and details of 
                the process in the announcement blog post.</p>
            
            <p> <b> Are the punks an ERC-721 token? </b></p>
            <p> No. The CryptoPunks pre-date the ERC-721 standard
                and are a custom contract, that means it doesn't 
                comply with any standards. They are almost an ERC20 
                token. We support the methods that provide your 
                balance so you can watch CryptoPunks as a token 
                in your wallet and see how many you own. None of 
                the other methods are the same since you're not 
                transferring a simple balance, but need to reference 
                which specific Punk you want to work with.
            </p>
            <p> <b> Where does the market data on this site come from? </b></p>
            <p> The prices, bids and sales you see on this site are loaded 
                from the Cryptopunks contract on the Ethereum blockchain. 
                Because the Cryptopunks pre-date the ERC-721 standard 
                (and all third party NFT marketplaces) we also needed 
                to write a market so the punks could be transacted. 
                We have no control over the contract governing this market, 
                and have no access to any additional data beyond what the 
                blockchain provides. In fact anyone else could write a web 
                front end for it.</p>

            <p> <b> Do you charge any fees for transactions? </b></p>
            <p> No. We charge no fees for Cryptopunks transacted through 
                the built-in market beyond the ones charged by Ethereum (gas).
                The contract source and more technical details are available on Github.</p>
